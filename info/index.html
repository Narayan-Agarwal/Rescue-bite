        <p>GHI reference year 1992<br>
            Proportion of undernourished (in percent) 24.9 16.9 1.0 74.7<br>
            Prevalence of underweight in children (in percent) 22.9 13.3 1.2 61.8<br>

        <p>South Asia in the 1990s: Hunger Amidst Progress
            South Asia in the 1990s was a complex landscape of progress and persistent challenges. While economic liberalization and growing agricultural production led to overall improvements in living standards, hunger remained a significant issue, particularly in rural areas. Millions were still grappling with poverty, malnutrition, and food insecurity. The Green Revolution, while increasing food production, had uneven impacts, often benefiting larger landowners while marginalizing smallholders. Additionally, natural disasters like floods and droughts exacerbated the situation, leaving many vulnerable populations without adequate food supplies.</p>

    <div class="h2011">
        <img src="2011.png">
        <p>The 2011 Global Hunger Index, published jointly by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), Concern Worldwide, and
            Welthungerhilfe, shows that although the world has made some progress
            in reducing hunger, the proportion of hungry people remains too high. Of
            course, the absolute number of hungry people remains unacceptably high
            as well. This is the sixth year that IFPRI has calculated the Global Hunger Index and analyzed this multidimensional measure of global hunger.
            It is important to note that the GHI scores present country averages: even
            in countries classified as having “moderate” or “serious” hunger, there
            can be areas where the situation is “alarming” or “extremely alarming.”
            Additionally, gains in hunger eradication can be eroded or even washed
            away by severe shocks, as evidenced by the 2011 food crisis in the Horn
            of Africa, when underlying vulnerabilities persist and are not adequately
            addressed. This series of reports records the state of hunger worldwide
            and country by country, drawing attention to the countries and regions
            where action is most needed. In this way, the reports support both national and international policy efforts and advocacy work.</p>
            <p>Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2011

                The Global Hunger Index (GHI) in 2011 showed progress but persistent challenges. <br>
                
                Overall Improvement: The world's GHI had decreased by 26% since 1990.<br>
                Score: The global GHI score in 2011 was 14.6.
                Regional Disparities: While many countries made strides, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continued to face severe hunger issues.<br>
                Note: The GHI is calculated based on three indicators:<br>
                
                Undernourishment<br>
                Child underweight<br>
                Child mortality<br>
                </p>

    <div class="h2019">
        <img src="46b68b25-0a66-367c-8f1d-a37bffc4b222.png">
        <p>Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2019<br>
            The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2019 indicated a global level of hunger and undernutrition on the cusp of the moderate and serious categories.<br>
            
            Global GHI Score: 20.0<br>
            Improvement: This represents a 31% decline since 2000.<br>
            Categorization: While progress has been made, the score places global hunger in a concerning range.<br>
            Key Points:<br>
            
            The GHI is calculated based on four indicators:<br>
            1. Undernourishment<br>2. Child stunting<br>3. Child wasting<br>4. Child mortality<br>
            Despite overall improvement, significant disparities exist between countries and regions.
            Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continue to face the most severe hunger challenges.</p>
            <p> The 2019 GHI shows that
                multiple countries have higher hunger levels now than in 2010, and
                approximately 45 countries are set to fail to achieve low levels of hunger by 2030. Conflict, inequality, and the effects of climate change
                have all contributed to persistently high levels of hunger and food
                insecurity around the world.</p>

        <p>Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021<br>
            The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2021 revealed a serious level of hunger globally.<br>
            
            Global GHI Score: 27.6<br>
            Categorization: This places global hunger in the "serious" category.<br>
            Progress Stalled: While progress had been made in previous years, the 2021 GHI indicated a stalling in global efforts to eradicate hunger.<br>
            Key Points:<br>
            
            The COVID-19 pandemic was identified as a major factor contributing to the worsening hunger situation.<br>
            Regional disparities persisted, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continuing to face the most severe challenges.
            The GHI is calculated based on four indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.</p>
            <p>Recent reports have already sounded the alarm. The State of Food
                Security and Nutrition in the World 2021 emphasizes that undernourishment was on the rise even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
                which has only exacerbated food insecurity. The Global Report on
                Food Crises 2021 points to the growing magnitude and severity of
                food crises in 2020 and the grim outlook for 2021. The World Food
                Programme warns that 41 million people are “teetering on the very
                edge of famine.”</p>

        <p>
            Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023<br>
The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023 painted a concerning picture of global hunger.<br>

Global GHI Score: 18.3<br>
Categorization: This places global hunger in the "moderate" category, but it's important to note that this is a slight improvement over the 2015 score and masks significant regional disparities.<br>
Stalled Progress: The report highlighted a worrying trend of stalled progress in reducing hunger since 2015.<br>
Key Findings:<br>

The number of undernourished people increased from 572 million in 2017 to approximately 735 million in 2022.<br>
The GHI is calculated based on four indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.<br>
Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continue to face the most severe hunger challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI) shows that, after many
years of advancement up to 2015, progress against hunger worldwide remains largely at a standstill. As the effects of crises multiply
and intensify, more and more people are experiencing severe hunger,
with the situation expected to worsen throughout the year.
